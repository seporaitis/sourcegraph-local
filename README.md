# sourcegraph-local

A guide to run Sourcegraph locally.

## Limitations
* Single machine, single user - everything runs on your laptop.
* Not all extensions work (e.g. Sentry doesn’t support custom domain)
* Can die occasionally (although in practice that happened maybe twice in two weeks for me, so it’s not annoying - you just restart the container)
* This has been tested on macOs, but should not be much different on Linux.

## Prerequisites:
* `docker` and `docker compose`

## Setup

Setup instructions are on my blog.
